## HW 3 overview:

For HW 3, i plan to go over option 2, which is creating an info-graphic using data I chose and displaying three different charts.

My question for this project is: **What is the general crime statistics in LA County?**

My question changed from the previous question I had, so now my question is much more broad. The reason it is broad is for one reason:

I'm still looking for what story angle I want to go with, whether its a focus on teen stats, weapon stats, or victim stats. I'm still undecided, so I'm hoping that by HW 4, I will have decided on an angle for storytelling.

Previously, my worries were that i didnt have enough numerical variables. I have since realized that it is okay, as my personal goal of this project is to explore and reveal what story i can uncover from this dataset.

for the variables I plan on using, It will be victim sex/age/race, weapon description, crime description, area name(city), and date. Those 7 variables should give me enough data to uncover multiple stories from here.

So far, the graphs i produced for this data set is bar charts and pie charts. Using primarily tidyverse and ggplot2, I created three bar charts and two pie charts. all the bar charts are counts of either weapon description, crime description, or gun-usage description. I calculated that a hand help gun is the most common gun to use in crimes. Fun fact: it looks like a gun, so hopefully i can polish it up by HW 4 to have that gun-like effect. For my pie charts, I decided to create rings to represent handcuffs. I explore both the race count and area name count to create my pie chart. I have found that Hispanics and 77th street in downtown LA have the most crime reports.

I'm still debating whether to change one of my two charts into a bar chart, as I want to have a bit more variance. However i would rather go with another option of adding another viz to my info-graphic, essentially creating 4 plots.

As for inspiration, I decided to go with two options:

-   tidytuesday Dr. Who viz ([link](https://github.com/thedivtagguy/tidytuesday/tree/master/2023/week-48-nov-2023-doctor-who))

    -   I really like that they imported images from another app to add to R. I use procreate(drawing app) a lot for my logo designs, so having the option to add some of my designs to my viz in R is a possibility i didnt consider before seeing this example

-   UFO sightings viz ([link](https://github.com/doehm/tidytues?tab=readme-ov-file#week-25-ufo-sightings))

    -   I really like how the theme really plays up with aliens, the dark night, and green-tech font. I think the way they managed to get the theme very well is what I hope to really encapsulate with my data viz.

As for my data viz design idea, I wanted to create a detective investigation pinboard, and have it look like it is a part of an investigation. A rough sketch is ![down below!](C:/Users/rosem/Downloads/hw3_roughdraft.jpg){fig-alt="Showing an investigation pinboard. Pinboard is brown, with three main body parts to represent my data. big title in the top middle says 'LA Crimes'. I also have several large dots to represent more viz to add and red string to show all the data connections to each other."}

Challenges I encountered while creating my data viz is my rough draft not looking very good at all. Since I am currently drawing and exporting all the images and colors I will use for my viz from procreate (similar to the Dr. Who viz), My plots will look plain. Im hoping however that by HW 4, my info-graphic should be completed and look much better.

Packages I will be using for my project:

```{r packages}
#using these three packages
library(tidyverse) #main use for data wrangling
library(janitor) #helps with clean names for my variables
library(lubridate) #need this for my time data. Mostly for wrangling time data
library(stringr) #this helps with dealing with strings and characters in my data
library(magick) #this calls in images
library(gridExtra) #organizing my plot
library(patchwork) #organizing my plots even better
```

reading in my CSV on LA Crimes from 2020 - Present (Jan 18 2024)

```{r data}

  clean_names()

```
